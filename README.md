Dice Repo
=========
This dice library is a work in progress (being rewritten). It is meant to be the one dice roller (rolling and statistics) to rule them all.
The rewritten version is still missing some functionality but the old version had it all:
excluding performance and visuals of dice, I only know of **one** thing it was missing:
an arbitrary grouping of dice syntax such as (1d6)d4. Which I thought [Roll20](https://wiki.roll20.net/Dice_Reference)
had at one point... I was at one point working on this functionality in the function groupParser.

The old version had: rolling dice, drawing dice distribution curves, dice and dicepool objects that
allow any kind of custom die, convenience functions for common things like DnDAttack, IronClawOpposedRoll,
and WarhammerAttackUnit.
