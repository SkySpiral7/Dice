<p>If you need a specific rare material in Monster Hunter World then input the stats of hunting a single monster and this will output the
   probability of each possible number of material you'll get.
   This programs calculates as much as possible and is pessimistic about the rest so that your actual odds should be better than reported.
   This scrapes data from <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">https://mhworld.kiranico.com/</a>.
   Text with red underline will show the name of the table from <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">kiranico</a> when you hover over it.
   First of all some terminology: a reward slot is a single square on the results page after a hunt. Each reward slot generally has 1
   material but it can have more than 1.
   <span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span> and <span title="Rewards: Capture" class="hoverInfo">Capture</span> are
   always identical tables the only difference is that you can always carve a dead monster 4 times, each of which puts in your box
   the equivalent of a reward slot (it won't be on the results page), but capturing will give 4 or 5 reward slots.
   However since I don't know the criteria/formula for when you would get 5 this calculator assumes you get 4 and
   thus they are completely identical which is why there's no input to indicate if the monster was captured.
   <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> you get whether you kill or capture and is 4-8 reward slots however I once
   again don't know the criteria/formula so this assumes 4. An expedition would give 3-4 reward slots from the
   <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> table but this calculator assumes you aren't doing an expedition.
   <span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span>/<span title="Rewards: Capture" class="hoverInfo">Capture</span> and
   <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> are based on the large monster (I don't know how expeditions or multiple large
   monsters are calculated) and those tables are scraped from the large monster's page
   (and thus are covered by the name and material inputs).
   <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> is specific to the quest taken and this info can be found on
   <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/quests">kiranico</a> as well.
   <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> will give 4-8 reward slots but the first
   <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> reward slot is always 100%
   (and thus doesn't need to be calculated) thus this calculator assumes 3.
   You may input the info for <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> above however it's unlikely to have the desired
   material.
   Investigations do in fact have <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span>
   rewards which can be found <a href="https://game8.co/games/Monster-Hunter-World/archives/306257#hm_4">here</a>.
   You'll notice that (beside the 100%) they don't have percentages listed but this is the only place I could find the info.
   After a hunt the "Quest completion rewards" will have the rewards from both <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span>
   and <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> the only way to tell them apart is that the
   <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span>
   rewards are first then the 100% <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> reward then the rest of the
   <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> rewards. The "Quest completion rewards" can hold a
   maximum of 20 reward slots (each might have multiple copies of the material) which is enough room for the max 16 slots for single
   monster hunts. The box below it "Bonus rewards" has 20 slots for materials from breaking monster parts then for Capture rewards (they
   will be labeled). After that are the Investigation slots (max of 5?) then the 20 Palico slots and 20 Tailraider slots
   (10 gathered and 10 stolen each).</p>
<p>Some monster breaks involve multiple body parts, such as having 2 wings. In that case each wing has it's own HP but both wings
   need to be broken to receive the reward slot for the break therefore you can only get 1 reward slot per break table per monster. This
   is why the input for breaking is a checkbox instead of asking how many times.</p>
<p><a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">Kiranico</a> also has info on Tailraider Safari, Bandit Mantle, Plunderblade,
   Items Gathered by Palicoes, materials from Monster tracks, Dropped Material, Guiding lands, and basically everything you can think of.
   The Dropped Material table is
   what a monster may drop when they are toppled or have their body parts broken (the white items you have to pick up), which is not
   to be confused with the tables for "Break Rathalos's head" etc which are Bonus rewards for breaking monster parts at the end
   of a hunt. The calculator doesn't account for any of these except breaking and you should break as many parts are you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/EmVcV/zorah-magdaros">Zorah Magdaros</a> is excluded for now because the page's data
   is invalid: Carves master rank is missing, I don't know if it's ever possible to carve his corpse (so Carves: Carves should be N/A),
   Carves: Dropped Material is obviously impossible (you can break parts but not run to his feet to get a white material drop),
   Carves: Bandit Mantle is wrong since it lists non trade-in items, Carves: Plunderblade is impossible since your Palico won't help with
   the magma cores, Carves: Items Gathered by Palicoes is wrong since it lists a Bandit Mantle material, master rank of Rewards and
   Investigations are obviously wrong, Rewards: Capture Zorah Magdaros is probably impossible (ref:
   <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/quests/nXmB6/one-for-the-history-books">★4 One for the History Books</a>),
   and Investigations doesn't apply to him at all (I think). Rewards: Break Zorah Magdaros's head, Rewards: Break Zorah Magdaros's chest,
   and Rewards: Hunt Zorah Magdaros might be valid but it breaks too many assumptions for this calculator to handle. In the future I might
   add special logic for handling Zorah Magdaros.</p>
<p>Personal experience and rumors: I had all 20 "Quest completion rewards" filled in
   <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/quests/naKbA/redefining-the-power-couple">★5 Redefining the "Power Couple"</a> since it's a 2
   monster quest it makes me think I was cheated out of the 4 possible remaining reward slots.
   Supposedly a Lucky Voucher will guarantee the max of 8 <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span>
   rewards, I can't disprove that since
   I always get 8 when I have 0 faints and I usually don't faint. It is possible that the Lucky Voucher's description of
   "to add bonus rewards" is only talking about doubling the money (and thus doesn't affect what I call "reward slots" at all).
   Poogie does not affect the hunt at all (reward slots, material count, cash, or research points). Deal with it.
   Although if Poogie likes you (any amount) then you can use him to find treasure which are materials that could be sold.
   The armor skills Good Luck and Great Luck supposedly have a chance to increase the number of materials in a given reward slots but not
   the number of reward slots used and thus don't affect the chances of getting "at least 1" of the material desired. It would
   be very tedious to verify those skills since it would require doing a ton of hunts with the skill and comparing to the expected number
   of each material.</p>
