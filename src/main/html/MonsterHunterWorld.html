      /* Data validations:
       * 1 A tail can't both break and be severed
       * 2 Only a tail can be severed
       * 3 Rewards: Capture is same as Carves: Carves
       * 4 each table adds up to 100% (won't affect calculations but would be good to verify non bad data)
       * 5 LR monsters will have HR and MR fights
       * 6 HR monsters will have MR fights except ['Ancient Leshen', 'Leshen'] which are event only
       * 7 LR can't have purple investigation
       * 8 if a monster can be fought at rank then it must have all tables I look for (including investigations) except tail/breaks
       * 9 There will not be duplicate tables (auto ignores the rest)
       * 10 a table's material count is never 0
       * 11 a table will not have duplicate material of the same count. diff counts are fine
       * 12 monsters have the same breakable parts (including sever tail) at every rank
       * 13 every monster will have at least 1 break (excluding sever tail). if missing this is assumed partial data
       *
       * Ask data:
       * 1 are there any tables with duplicate material of diff count? Kulve Taroth HR Breaks
       * 2 are there any monsters who are MR only? looks like fatalis, safi-jiiva, silver-rathalos
       * 3 is each table highest % to least order? yes which is good for default material
       *
       * Data corrections:
       * 1 ignore duplicate tables keeping only the first
       * 2 I made a list of LR monsters. LR data from a monster not in the list is ignored
       * 3 if rank has none of the tables I check then delete that rank
       * 4 if sever and break tail then keep the sever
       * 5 if kill/capture tables don't match keep the kill (the capture tables I saw were all Monster Bone L 100%)
       * 6 Kushala Daora and Teostra don't have breakable forelimbs
       * 7 Safi'jiiva Master Rank Rewards > Capture Safi'jiiva Safi'jiiva Shard x1 22% should be Safi'jiiva Cortex to match the Kill table
       * 8 Ancient Leshen/Leshen don't have Investigations and are thus ignored. Leshen HR Bronze was the only one that looked valid anyway
       * 9 Nergigante doesn't have LR rewards. Break might be possible but I can't confirm that
       *
       * Assumptions (don't affect calc):
       * 1 Bandit Mantle only gives trade-in items (pretty sure the game says this)
       * 2 some monsters are not in low rank (I know this 1)
       * 3 some monsters are not in high rank (probably but not sure)
       * 4 master rank can fight everything and high can fight all low
       *
       * Notes:
       * 71 total monsters (including Zorah)

<div>
   <p>If you need a specific rare material in Monster Hunter World then input the stats of hunting a single monster and this will output the
      probability of each possible number of material you'll get.
      This programs calculates as much as possible and is pessimistic about the rest so that your actual odds should be better than
      reported.
      This uses a DB that was scraped from <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">https://mhworld.kiranico.com/</a>.
      Text with red underline will show the name of the table from <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">kiranico</a> when you hover over
      it.
      First of all some unofficial terminology: a reward slot is a single square on the results page after a hunt. Each reward slot
      generally has 1
      material but it can have more than 1.</p>
   <p><span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span> and <span title="Rewards: Capture" class="hoverInfo">Capture</span> are
      always identical tables the only difference is that you can always carve a dead monster 4 times, each of which puts in your box
      the equivalent of a reward slot (it won't be on the results page), but capturing will give 4 or 5 reward slots.
      However since I don't know the criteria/formula for when you would get 5 this calculator assumes you get 4 and
      thus they are completely identical which is why there's no input to indicate if the monster was captured.
      <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> you get whether you kill or capture and is 4-8 reward slots however I once
      again don't know the criteria/formula so this assumes 4. An expedition would give 3-4 reward slots from the
      <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> table but this calculator assumes you aren't doing an expedition.
      <span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span>/<span title="Rewards: Capture" class="hoverInfo">Capture</span> and
      <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> are based on the large monster (I don't know how expeditions or multiple
      large
      monsters are calculated) and those tables are scraped from the large monster's page
      (and thus are covered by the name and material inputs).
      <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> is specific to the quest taken and this info can be found on
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/quests">kiranico</a> as well.
      <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> will give 4-8 reward slots but the first
      <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> reward slot is always 100%
      (and thus doesn't need to be calculated) thus this calculator assumes 3.
      You may input the info for <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> above however it's unlikely to have the desired
      material.
      Investigations do in fact have <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span>
      rewards which can be found <a href="https://game8.co/games/Monster-Hunter-World/archives/306257#hm_4">here</a>.
      You'll notice that (beside the 100%) they don't have percentages listed but this is the only place I could find the info.</p>
   <p>After a hunt the "Quest completion rewards" will have the rewards from both <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span>
      and <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> the only way to tell them apart is that the
      <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span>
      rewards are first then the 100% <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> reward then the rest of the
      <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> rewards. The "Quest completion rewards" can hold a
      maximum of 20 reward slots (each might have multiple copies of the material) which is enough room for the max 16 slots for single
      monster hunts. The box below it "Bonus rewards" has 20 slots for materials from breaking monster parts then for Capture rewards (they
      will be labeled). After that are the Investigation slots (max of 5?) then the 20 Palico slots and 20 Tailraider slots
      (10 gathered and 10 stolen each).</p>
   <p>Some monster breaks involve multiple body parts, such as having 2 wings. In that case each wing has it's own HP but both wings
      need to be broken to receive the reward slot for the break (for "Break Rathalos's wings") therefore you can only get 1 reward slot
      per break table per monster. This
      is why the input for breaking is a checkbox instead of asking how many times. There is a partial exception for
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/aYaUV/nergigante">Nergigante</a> and
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/oAnim/ruiner-nergigante">Ruiner Nergigante</a> who have "break horn" and "break horns"
      as separate tables for breaking 1 horn then both horns.
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/oAnim/ruiner-nergigante">Ruiner Nergigante</a>
      also has separate tables for each front leg and each wing these cases are covered by having separate checkboxes
      (in this case 8 of them).</p>
   <p><a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">Kiranico</a> also has info on Tailraider Safari, Bandit Mantle, Plunderblade,
      Items Gathered by Palicoes, materials from Monster tracks, Dropped Material, Guiding lands, and basically everything you can think of.
      The Dropped Material table is
      what a monster may drop when they are toppled or have their body parts broken (the white items you have to pick up), which is not
      to be confused with the tables for "Break Rathalos's head" etc which are Bonus rewards for breaking monster parts at the end
      of a hunt. The calculator doesn't account for any of these except breaking and you should break as many parts are you can.</p>
   <p><a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/EmVcV/zorah-magdaros">Zorah Magdaros</a> is excluded for now because the page's data
      is invalid: Carves master rank is missing, I don't know if it's ever possible to carve his corpse (so Carves: Carves should be N/A),
      Carves: Dropped Material is obviously impossible (you can break parts but not run to his feet to get a white material drop),
      Carves: Bandit Mantle is wrong since it lists non trade-in items, Carves: Plunderblade is impossible since your Palico won't help with
      the magma cores, Carves: Items Gathered by Palicoes is wrong since it lists a Bandit Mantle material, master rank of Rewards and
      Investigations are obviously wrong, Rewards: Capture Zorah Magdaros is probably impossible (ref:
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/quests/nXmB6/one-for-the-history-books">★4 One for the History Books</a>),
      and Investigations doesn't apply to him at all (I think). Rewards: Break Zorah Magdaros's head, Rewards: Break Zorah Magdaros's chest,
      and Rewards: Hunt Zorah Magdaros might be valid but it breaks too many assumptions for this calculator to handle. In the future I
      might
      add special logic for handling Zorah Magdaros.</p>
   <p>It turns out that all 71 (including Zorah Magdaros) large monster pages have some part of the data incorrect. The calculations
      will run on partial data in order to give the best results possible. For duplicate tables I kept the first. For monsters that I know
      aren't in Low Rank I ignored the LR column. If a non-LR rank column didn't include any of the 4 Investigations,
      <span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span>, <span title="Rewards: Capture" class="hoverInfo">Capture</span>,
      <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span>, breaks, and sever tail then I ignored the rest of the column and assumed
      that the monster can't be fought at that rank. If page said that a tail could be both severed and broken then I ignored the break.
      If <span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span> and <span title="Rewards: Capture" class="hoverInfo">Capture</span>
      didn't match I kept <span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span>. Elder Dragons had
      <span title="Rewards: Capture" class="hoverInfo">Capture</span> ignored since they can't be captured.
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/jJxin/kushala-daora">Kushala Daora</a> and
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/jGeS0/teostra">Teostra</a> don't have breakable forelimbs (tables ignored).
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/0kVsV/safi-jiiva">Safi'jiiva</a> Master Rank Rewards: Capture Safi'jiiva table
      row Safi'jiiva Shard x1 22% should be Safi'jiiva Cortex to match <span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span> and to
      avoid duplication (I corrected this). <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/N3vuk/ancient-leshen">Ancient Leshen</a> and
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/GmYh0/leshen">Leshen</a> don't have Investigations and are thus ignored
      (Leshen HR Bronze was the only one that looked valid anyway).
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/monsters/aYaUV/nergigante">Nergigante</a> doesn't have LR rewards
      (break might be possible but I can't confirm that) so I ignored that rank.</p>
   <p>Personal experience and rumors: I had all 20 "Quest completion rewards" filled in
      <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/quests/naKbA/redefining-the-power-couple">★5 Redefining the "Power Couple"</a> since it's a 2
      monster quest it makes me think I was cheated out of the 4 possible remaining reward slots.
      Supposedly a Lucky Voucher will guarantee the max of 8 <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span>
      rewards, I can't disprove that since
      I always get 8 when I have 0 faints and I usually don't faint. It is possible that the Lucky Voucher's description of
      "to add bonus rewards" is only talking about doubling the money (and thus doesn't affect what I call "reward slots" at all).
      Poogie does not affect the hunt at all (reward slots, material count, cash, or research points). Deal with it.
      Although if Poogie likes you (any amount) then you can use him to find treasure which are materials that could be sold.</p>
   <p>The armor skills Good Luck and Great Luck and the food skill Lucky Cat supposedly have a chance to increase the number of materials
      (0-5 more) in a given reward slot but not
      the number of reward slots used and thus don't affect the chances of getting "at least 1" of the material desired. It would
      be very tedious to verify those skills since it would require doing a ton of hunts with the skill and comparing to the expected number
      of each material. Armor skill Capture Master does the same thing but only if the monster is captured. The food skill Felyne Carver
      (Hi)
      on the other hand increases the number of times you can carve which would make
      <span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span> be 4-5 reward slots making it the same as the 4-5 normally gotten from
      capturing a monster. The details of all of these are unknown and thus not included but (unlike Poogie) aren't superstitious
      so it is a good idea to have them.</p>
