<p>If you need a specific rare material in Monster Hunter World then input the stats of hunting a single monster and this will output the probability
of each possible number of material you'll get.
This programs calculates as much as possible and is pessimistic about the rest so that your actual odds should be better than reported.
Refer to <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">https://mhworld.kiranico.com/</a> for all the info to fill in the form.
Text with red underline will show the name of the table from <a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">kiranico</a> when you hover over it.
<span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span> and <span title="Rewards: Capture" class="hoverInfo">Capture</span> are always identical tables the only difference is that you always carve 4 material but capturing will give
4 or 5 material. However since I don't know the criteria/formula for when you would get 5 this calculator assumes you get 4 and
thus they are completely identical. <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> you get whether you kill or capture and is 4-8 however I once again don't know the
criteria/formula so this assumes 4. An expedition would give 3-4 from <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> table but this calculator assumes you aren't doing an expedition.
<span title="Carves: Carves" class="hoverInfo">Carve</span>, <span title="Rewards: Capture" class="hoverInfo">Capture</span>, and <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> are based on the large monster (I don't know how expeditions or multiple large monsters are calculated)
and those tables are found on the large monster's page. <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> is specific to the quest taken and this info can be found on
<a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">kiranico</a>. <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> will give 4-8 rewards but the first <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> reward is always 100%
(and thus doesn't need to be calculated) thus the random reward this form uses is 3. Investigations do in fact have <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span>
rewards for them <a href="https://game8.co/games/Monster-Hunter-World/archives/306257#hm_4">click here</a>. You'll notice
that (beside the 100%) they don't have percentages listed but this is the only place I could find the info. After a hunt the
"Quest completion rewards" will have the rewards from both <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span> and <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> the only way to tell them apart is that the <span title="Rewards: Hunt" class="hoverInfo">Hunt</span>
rewards are first then the 100% <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> reward then the rest of the <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> rewards. The "Quest completion rewards" can hold a
maximum of 20 reward slots (each might have multiple copies of the material) which is enough room for the max 16 for single
monster hunts. The box below it "Bonus rewards" has 20 slots for materials from breaking monster parts then for Capture rewards (they will be labeled).
After that are the Investigation slots then the 20 Palico slots and 20 Tailraider slots.</p>
<p><a href="https://mhworld.kiranico.com/">Kiranico</a> also has info on Tailraider Safari, Bandit Mantle, Plunderblade, Items Gathered by Palicoes
materials from Monster tracks, Dropped Material, and basically everything you can think of. The Dropped Material table is
what a monster may drop when they are toppled or have their body parts broken (the white items you have to pick up). Not
to be confused with the tables for "Break Rathalos's head" etc which are Bonus rewards for breaking monster parts at the end
of a hunt. The calculator doesn't account for any of these however you should break as many parts are you can.</p>
<p>Personal experience and rumors: I had all 20 "Quest completion rewards" filled in Redefining the "Power Couple" 2 monster quest which makes me think
I was cheated out of the 4 possible remaining rewards. Supposedly a Lucky Voucher will guarantee the max of 8 <span title="Quest Rewards" class="hoverInfo">Quest</span> rewards, I can't disprove that since
I always get 8 when I have 0 faints and I usually don't faint. It is possible that the Lucky Voucher's description of
"to add bonus rewards" is only talking about doubling the money (and thus doesn't affect materials at all).
Poogie does not affect any rewards (reward slots, material count, cash, or research points). Deal with it.
Although if Poogie likes you (any amount) then you can use him to find treasure which are materials that could be sold.
The armor skills Good Luck and Great Luck supposedly have a chance to increase the number of materials in a given slot but not
the number of reward slots used and thus don't affect the chances of getting "at least 1" of the material desired. It would
be very tedious to verify those skills since it would require doing a ton of hunts with the skill and comparing to the expected number
of each material.</p>
